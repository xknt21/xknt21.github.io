[{"content":"Ideas: Problem Statement Participatory budgeting (PB) empowers citizens to influence how public funds are allocated. However, challenges persist in ensuring fairness, transparency, and effective data utilization within these processes. Traditional methods may not adequately capture diverse community needs or leverage data-driven insights for optimal decision-making.​\nData Acquisition Sources of Data:\nHistorical PB election data from platforms like Pabulib, encompassing over 650 Polish PB elections.\nOpen budget data from government portals and initiatives like Open Spending.\nSurvey responses and feedback collected via mobile apps, social media, and CRM systems.​\nData Collection Methods:\nUtilize tools such as Pabutools for parsing and organizing PB datasets.\nConduct mobile surveys and community outreach to gather qualitative data on citizen preferences and sentiments.​\nData Processing and Analysis Analytical Tools and Techniques:\nEmploy Pabustats to simulate outcomes under various PB rules (e.g., Method of Equal Shares vs. Utilitarian Greedy) to assess fairness and utility.\nApply machine learning models to learn and generate aggregation rules that balance social welfare and representation.\nUse natural language processing (NLP) to analyze public sentiment from discussion forums and survey responses.\nImplement clustering or regression models to identify features in PB software that correlate with higher participation rates.​\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11035\nData Presentation Visualization and Engagement Strategies:\nDevelop interactive dashboards and visualizations (e.g., budget allocation maps, cost-benefit charts) to enhance transparency.\nUse platforms like Open Spending to create accessible and engaging representations of budget data.\nConduct A/B testing with different ballot formats (e.g., approval vs. score voting) to determine impacts on voter satisfaction and project diversity.\nLeverage mobile applications and social media channels to disseminate information and gather real-time feedback from citizens.​\nhttps://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0297.pdf\nReferences P.

It’s especially useful for individuals with specific needs, such as people with disabilities or those looking for clean and accessible facilities. Here’s what it does:\nRush Hour Detection: The app checks the current time and location data to determine how busy certain restrooms might be. During peak hours, it can suggest less crowded alternatives nearby, helping users avoid long waits.\nWheelchair Accessibility: The app filters and highlights restrooms that are equipped to support wheelchair users. This includes features like ramps, wide doors, and handrails, ensuring the facilities are safe and easy to use.\nRatings and Reviews: Users can view ratings on how clean, well-maintained, and functional each restroom is. They can also leave their own reviews and feedback, helping others make informed decisions.\nReal-Time Location Display: It shows the exact location of each toilet on a map, including directions and estimated walking time from the user’s current location.\nAccessibility Information: It displays if the place is accessible whether there’s elevators for people in wheelchairs.\nParking Finder Application Around the sightseeing area, There is always the problem that people cannot find the parking lot. This Application is a convenient feature designed to help users locate nearby parking spaces efficiently. It provides real-time updates on the availability of parking spots, letting users know whether a lot is full or still has space. This reduces the frustration of circling around looking for parking, especially in busy urban areas. In addition to availability, the app also displays the pricing for each parking location, allowing users to compare rates at a glance. Whether someone is looking for the cheapest option or the closest one, they can make an informed choice based on live data. The app also shows the exact location and distance of the parking spaces from the user’s current position, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience.\nCarbon Emission Application This Application is a feature that tracks and displays the level of carbon emissions in different regions. By using real-time environmental data, the application can detect how much carbon dioxide is being released in a specific area.\nApplication for Blinds This application is specifically designed to support blind individuals who may require assistance in their daily lives, especially when navigating unfamiliar or challenging environments. When a user needs help—such as crossing a street, locating a building, or dealing with an unexpected obstacle—they can use the app to request assistance. The application then connects them with nearby volunteers, support staff, or designated helpers who can provide real-time aid. Through features like voice commands, GPS tracking, and live communication, the app ensures that blind users can receive timely, location-based help, enhancing their independence and safety in public spaces.\n","permalink":"https://xknt21.github.io/contents/apr8/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"ideas\"\u003eIdeas:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"toilet-finder-application\"\u003eToilet Finder Application\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis application is a smart feature designed to help users locate nearby public restrooms quickly and conveniently.
