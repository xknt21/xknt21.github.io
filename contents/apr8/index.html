Here’s how it works:\nRush Hour Detection: The application cross-checks the time and location information to find out how busy certain restrooms are. At rush hour, it will suggest less busy ones around so the users don’t have to wait.\nWheelchair Accessibility: The application screens and displays restrooms that are wheelchair-friendly. That is, facilities such as ramps, bigger doors, and handrails, so that the toilets are accessible and safe as well.\nRatings and Reviews: One can see the ratings of how clean, well-maintained, and functional every toilet is. One can even post their reviews and comments, allowing others to make the right choice.\nLive Location Display: It indicates the precise location of all toilets on a map with directions and walking distance estimated from the user’s position.\nAccessibility Information: It indicates whether the region is accessible with or without lifts for the disabled.\nParking Finder Application There is always a problem of people being unable to find a parking space within and around the tourist area. This App is a simple facility to help people locate vacant parking lots in an efficient way. It provides instant feedback on the number of available parking spaces, notifying the users whether the lot is full or not. This impedes parking cruising frustration, especially in busy city centres. Besides availability, the app also shows how much per parking space so that the users can see prices at a glance and compare in an instant. If anyone needs the nearest or the lowest priced one, then one can make the right choice with knowledge in a flash. The application also shows the exact location and distance of the parking lots from where the user is located, thus making the process an easy and convenient task.\nCarbon Emission Application The application is an original aspect that tracks and shows the level of carbon emissions in locations. The application can make estimates of the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted in an area depending on real-time environmental information.\nApplication for Blinds The application is intended for blind individuals who may require assistance with items in their lives, especially where they are new or challenging areas. If a user needs help, say to cross the road, move through a building, or get over some unexpected barrier, a person can use the app for help requests. The application then connects them with local volunteers, support staff, or assigned helpers who provide live comments. Through the incorporation of features like voice commands, global positioning, and live chat, the app provides location-based support at the moment to the blind person, thereby enhancing their safety and autonomy away from home.\nGovermental Transparency This is the main concern of the app in providing transparency and accountability for government spending. It aggregates data from official government reports and publicly disseminated announcements, following where tax dollars are flowing and being spent on what projects and initiatives. The app lays this out in plain, easy-to-understand terms, so users can easily see where the money is heading—infrastructure, education, healthcare, or otherwise. Through elucidating the monetary flows, the citizens are placed in a position where they have more knowledge and are interested in understanding how the government operates, thereby having a greater level of trust and responsive governance.\nMaximal Utilisation of Agricultural Land This is an influential aspect that leads to the productivity of a certain land. The higher productivity reduces the shortage of certain crops within a specific location. The applied information will be climatic information, soil information, and agricultural information. With this, the app would recommend a package of crops to communal farmers and occupational farmers. Farmers would choose one of the crops recommended in a bid to experience the highest possible yield, which would be most rewarding and combat communal hunger. Evacuation Assistant would lead the software user to evacuate a building room by determining the shortest path from the user to the exit, with robots/drones to scout around and check if it’s safe to proceed down that path.\n","wordCount":"705","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://xknt21.github.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-04-08T01:06:59+09:00","dateModified":"2025-04-08T01:06:59+09:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"PBL3 Group H"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://xknt21.github.io/contents/apr8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"PBL3 Group H","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://xknt21.github.io/PBL3/favicon-3.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://xknt21.github.io/ accesskey=h title="PBL3 Group H (Alt + H)">PBL3 Group H</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://xknt21.github.io/project/ title="Project Proposal"><span>Project Proposal</span></a></li><li><a href=https://xknt21.github.io/requirements/ title="Requirements Specification"><span>Requirements Specification</span></a></li><li><a href=https://xknt21.github.io/system/ title="System Design Document"><span>System Design Document</span></a></li><li><a href=https://xknt21.github.io/architecture/ title="System Architecture"><span>System Architecture</span></a></li><li><a href=https://xknt21.github.io/contents/ title="Schedule & Planning"><span>Schedule & Planning</span></a></li><li><a href=https://xknt21.github.io/presentation/ title=Presentation><span>Presentation</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://xknt21.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://xknt21.github.io/contents/>Contents</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">[Group Documentation] April 8 2025</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-04-08 01:06:59 +0900 JST'>April 8, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;705 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;PBL3 Group H&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/xknt21/xknt21.github.io/content/contents/Apr8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#ideas>Ideas:</a><ul><li><a href=#toilet-finder-application>Toilet Finder Application</a></li><li><a href=#parking-finder-application>Parking Finder Application</a></li><li><a href=#carbon-emission-application>Carbon Emission Application</a></li><li><a href=#application-for-blinds>Application for Blinds</a></li><li><a href=#govermental-transparency>Govermental Transparency</a></li><li><a href=#maximal-utilisation-of-agricultural-land>Maximal Utilisation of Agricultural Land</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=ideas>Ideas:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ideas>#</a></h2><h3 id=toilet-finder-application>Toilet Finder Application<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#toilet-finder-application>#</a></h3><p>This is a smart app feature designed to help users easily and effectively find public toilets in their environment.
