Moreover, the document adheres to a prefix convention that follows the following format:\nFR-X.x refers to Functional Requirements with their corresponding branches or sub-requirements. Within each functional requirement, the description shall start with its user requirements, followed by the system requirements. NFR-X.x refers to Non-Functional Requirements with their corresponding branches or sub-requirements. Expected Readership This document is intended for various readers who may be involved in the development, deployment, and use of the system as indicated in the table below:\nIntended Reader Relevant Document Sections System Developers and Engineers - Version History- Document Conventions- System Functionality- Use Cases - Glossary - Functional Requirements - Non-Functional Requirements Project Managers and Coordinators - Preface - Introduction - Glossary System Analysts and Designers - Introduction - Glossary - Functional Requirements - Non-Functional Requirements End Users (Volunteers and Animal Hospital Staff) - Introduction - Glossary Administrators - Use Cases - Glossary - Functional Requirements Test Engineers - System Functionality - Use Cases - Glossary - Functional Requirements - Non-Functional Requirements Documentation Lead and Team - Preface - Glossary Introduction This document is the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the “Smart Re-Identification System for Stray Cats Post-TNR Program” project. It outlines the system’s functionality, expected behaviour, and constraints relevant to its deployment and use. The document aims to ensure that all stakeholders or potential users understand what the system will do and how it will operate.\nObjectives The main goal of this system is to prevent redundant medical checkups on stray cats by enabling volunteers and animal hospitals to verify if a cat has already been captured and treated. The system achieves this by using a re-identification system to match submitted photos of stray cats with an existing database. The objectives can be summarised in the following points:\nPrevent the same stray cat from being taken to the hospital multiple times. Assist volunteers by providing quick and reliable re-identification of cats through images. Improve coordination among different users (individual caretakers, organisations, and animal hospitals). Increase efficiency and reduce mistakes in TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) operations. Scope The system will initially target users in the Kansai region in Japan with the capability to accommodate up to 1000 volunteers and 3 animal hospitals. This system will only implement core functions such as photo submission, profile management, and cat profile actions for volunteers and animal hospitals.\nSystem Functionality Allow users to upload images of stray cats and receive feedback on possible profile matches. Display cat profiles which include details such as medical history, approximate age, and gender. Enable role-based account types with varying access for volunteers, animal hospitals, and organisations. Allow animal hospitals to make changes and adjustments to cat profiles and medical records Allow users to make suggestions and reports to administrators Intended End Users This system is designed primarily for the following groups who are actively involved in the care and management of stray cats. Each user group interacts with the system in different ways, and their specific needs have been considered in the requirements specification.\n1. Individual Volunteers\nIndividual caretakers or citizens who care for stray cats in their local areas. They will be able to submit cat sightings, upload images, and check for past records to help institutions avoid redundant capture or treatment. They will fall under the volunteer class in the system.\n2. Animal Rescue Organisations (e.g., TNR Groups, NPOs, Community Members)\nFormal or informal groups involved in TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) or rescue activities. They use the system for cat status tracking, profile management, and collaboration with animal hospitals. They will fall under the volunteer class in the system.\n3. Veterinary Clinics and Animal Hospitals\nThese facilities use the system to avoid treating the same cat multiple times, access a cat’s vaccination/surgery records, and any necessary documentation. They will fall under the animal hospital class in the system.\nUse Cases Use Case Diagram User Classes Characteristics Volunteer: Includes individual caretakers, rescue groups, and TNR organizations.\nAnimal Hospital: Clinics and staff involved in stray cat intake and treatment.\nAdministrator: System-level operators responsible for moderation and account management.\nUse Case Table Number Name Description Associated Functional Requirement(s) U-1 Sign up User creates a new account in the system.

It outlines the system&rsquo;s functionality, expected behaviour, and constraints relevant to its deployment and use. The document aims to ensure that all stakeholders or potential users understand what the system will do and how it will operate.</p><h3 id=objectives><strong>Objectives</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#objectives>#</a></h3><p>The main goal of this system is to prevent redundant medical checkups on stray cats by enabling volunteers and animal hospitals to verify if a cat has already been captured and treated. The system achieves this by using a re-identification system to match submitted photos of stray cats with an existing database. The objectives can be summarised in the following points:</p><ul><li>Prevent the same stray cat from being taken to the hospital multiple times.</li><li>Assist volunteers by providing quick and reliable re-identification of cats through images.</li><li>Improve coordination among different users (individual caretakers, organisations, and animal hospitals).</li><li>Increase efficiency and reduce mistakes in TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) operations.</li></ul><h3 id=scope><strong>Scope</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#scope>#</a></h3><p>The system will initially target users in the Kansai region in Japan with the capability to accommodate up to 1000 volunteers and 3 animal hospitals. This system will only implement core functions such as photo submission, profile management, and cat profile actions for volunteers and animal hospitals.</p><h3 id=system-functionality><strong>System Functionality</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#system-functionality>#</a></h3><ul><li>Allow users to upload images of stray cats and receive feedback on possible profile matches.</li><li>Display cat profiles which include details such as medical history, approximate age, and gender.</li><li>Enable role-based account types with varying access for volunteers, animal hospitals, and organisations.</li><li>Allow animal hospitals to make changes and adjustments to cat profiles and medical records</li><li>Allow users to make suggestions and reports to administrators</li></ul><h3 id=intended-end-users><strong>Intended End Users</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#intended-end-users>#</a></h3><p>This system is designed primarily for the following groups who are actively involved in the care and management of stray cats. Each user group interacts with the system in different ways, and their specific needs have been considered in the requirements specification.</p><p>1. <strong>Individual Volunteers</strong></p><p>Individual caretakers or citizens who care for stray cats in their local areas. They will be able to submit cat sightings, upload images, and check for past records to help institutions avoid redundant capture or treatment. They will fall under the volunteer class in the system.</p><p>2. <strong>Animal Rescue Organisations (e.g., TNR Groups, NPOs, Community Members)</strong></p><p>Formal or informal groups involved in TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) or rescue activities. They use the system for cat status tracking, profile management, and collaboration with animal hospitals. They will fall under the volunteer class in the system.</p><p>3. <strong>Veterinary Clinics and Animal Hospitals</strong></p><p>These facilities use the system to avoid treating the same cat multiple times, access a cat’s vaccination/surgery records, and any necessary documentation. They will fall under the animal hospital class in the system.</p><h3 id=use-cases><strong>Use Cases</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#use-cases>#</a></h3><h4
