## Ideas:   

### Highway Route Optimization
Would optimize the route across an expressway for vehicles to avoid traffic.   

### Low-Light Area Detectors    
Use location of areas that are not lit up during the night to advise the government where to install street-lighting systems to improve nighttime visibility and increase safety of such low-light areas.   

### Urban Shadow-Tracker    
Detects public areas with too much and too less shade to predict and provide recommendations for the government to plant trees and install solar panels to reduce public over-exposure to solar radiation.

### Advanced Job-Matching Software
 **Problem Statement:** In recent times, the job market has been fiercely competitive, meaning that the number of applicants outnumbers the number of jobs available. Moreover, many new occupations and skills are emerging in the market, but potential employees cannot utilise these opportunities due to their lack of familiarity with them.   

 **Objective:** I propose to use data analytics to find these emerging skill gaps in the workforce market and match people having such skills to jobs with a growing demand requiring them.
