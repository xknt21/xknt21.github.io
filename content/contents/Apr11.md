## Ideas:   

### Highway Route Optimization
Would optimize the route across an expressway for vehicles to avoid traffic.   

### Low-Light Area Detectors    
Use location of areas that are not lit up during the night to advise the government where to install street-lighting systems to improve nighttime visibility and increase safety of such low-light areas.   

### Urban Shadow-Tracker    
Detects public areas with too much and too less shade to predict and provide recommendations for the government to plant trees and install solar panels to reduce public over-exposure to solar radiation.
