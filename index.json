[{"content":"Smart Re-Identification Application for Stray Cats Post-SNR Program Problem Elicitation / Background Urban animal shelters, particularly in regions like Taiwan, are heavily burdened and face legal or ethical restrictions against euthanizing animals. Following the Shelter-Neuter-Return (SNR) program, many cats are released back into the urban environment without systematic tracking, making it difficult to monitor their wellbeing or promote their adoption.\nThere is a growing societal need for a solution that maintains a connection with these cats after their return, fostering animal welfare and enabling post-release care and adoption opportunities.\nRelated Applications Current applications primarily focus on pet identification and lost pet recovery (e.g., PetFinder, PawBoost). However, few address the unique needs of tracking and re-identifying community cats post-SNR programs at a societal scale.\nAdditionally, existing apps generally require owners\u0026rsquo; cooperation, while stray cats post-SNR lack dedicated guardians, highlighting a gap in service.\nLiterature Review and Government Reports Crawford Cat Dataset (Kaggle): A dataset containing labeled images of cats, useful for training initial models. \u0026ldquo;Siamese Networks for Cat Re-identification\u0026rdquo; (PapersWithCode): Demonstrates the efficacy of Siamese Networks in distinguishing between highly similar individual animals. Government Reports: Recent e-petitions in Taiwan indicate increasing public demand for humane stray animal management without euthanasia, emphasizing the importance of SNR initiatives. Other References: arXiv 2501.02112v1 - Latest methods for animal re-identification. HAL Archive Paper - Research on sustainable animal tracking. Springer Book Chapter - Machine learning for animal welfare solutions. Vision and Goals Promote Adoption: Maintain adoption opportunities post-release. Enhance Social Connection: Build a cat-friendly urban culture through awareness and interaction. Track Wellbeing: Monitor health and safety of community cats after release. Verify Vaccination: Enable instant verification of vaccination status through recognition. Objectives - Features to be Realized Develop a mobile application with real-time cat recognition via camera input. Display cat profiles including health, vaccination, and adoption information. Geolocation tagging to track areas where cats are frequently sighted. User feedback system to report injuries, illnesses, or sightings. Dashboards to visualize model performance (precision, recall). Scope (How Big the Problem Is) Tens of thousands of cats participate in SNR programs annually in Taiwan alone. Urban environments are dynamic and cats are mobile, making continuous manual tracking impossible without technological aid. This project targets urban centers with a dense SNR population, aiming to scale nationally or internationally.\n##　Limitations and Risks\nAccuracy Challenges: Recognizing individual cats with subtle visual differences may cause errors. Data Quality: User-submitted images may be blurry, low-quality, or mislabeled. Privacy Concerns: Collecting geolocation data needs careful ethical consideration. Adoption Reluctance: Users may scan cats but few may move forward with adoptions. Sustainability (Future Extensions) Integrate with shelter databases for automatic record updates. Expand to other species (e.g., dogs in TNR programs). Implement reward systems to encourage citizen participation. Utilize blockchain for decentralized, transparent health record-keeping. Data Acquisition Sources: Public datasets, shelter photo archives, user-submitted images. Methods: Collaboration with shelters for multi-angle pre-release photos. Data augmentation techniques to artificially expand datasets. Web scraping from shelter websites and social media. Preprocessing using OpenCV (cropping, noise reduction, normalization). Data Processing Apply image preprocessing (cropping, resizing, normalizing). Organize datasets by unique individual cat ID when available. Augment data for robustness against lighting and angle variations. Data Science Techniques Recognition Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. YOLOv2 and MobileNet for efficient, mobile-friendly detection. Siamese Networks for fine-grained individual cat re-identification. Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Model Inference Speed. Existing Prototypes Siamese Networks for pet re-identification exist but are not widely adopted in stray tracking scenarios. YOLO and MobileNet have lightweight mobile-ready models but need fine-tuning for the cat-specific domain.

Another idea is to create an approval system using a machine learning model or NLP model to filter out suggestions that are most likely not approved by the government or implement a system where a certain suggestion must reach a certain threshold to either be implemented or suggested in the first place.\nLow-Light Area Detecting Software: Problem Statement: Inadequate street lighting poses serious risks to public safety, including increased crime rates, higher chances of accidents, and reduced visibility for pedestrians and vehicles. Many urban and suburban areas lack comprehensive monitoring systems to identify regions with poor night-time illumination. Manual surveys are time-consuming, costly, and often outdated by the time they are compiled. There is a pressing need for an automated, scalable solution that can analyze geotagged nighttime imagery to detect and map low-light areas.\nObjective Statement: This software aims to utilize machine learning and image processing techniques to identify underlit regions using publicly available or crowdsourced street-level images and generate a dynamic heatmap to aid city planners and safety authorities in prioritizing lighting improvements.\nData Acquisition: Data will be obtained from open-source street view images available through sources like Google StreetView API. Further, we will be able to train a machine learning model to detect the presence of street lamps using images present on the Open Source Image Dataset V7 by Google Developers. The images from that dataset will be used for all the training, validation, and testing processes. As for the geotagged images, we will primarily use StreetView API, and we will also collect a few images ourselves.\nData Processing: Image processing will be used in this project idea for detecting streetlights. First the image will be segmented, and then the model will detect the presence of the streetlight. The YOLOv8 pretrained machine learning model will be used for this purpose.\nData Sources: Google StreetView API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/overview Open-Source Image Dataset V7: https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html\nSimilar Idea: https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/ja/map/map_285407#16/34.9972/138.4414\nTask: (Until April 24, 2025) Project proposal, it has to have the problem definition , related applications and literature or governmental report.

It\u0026rsquo;s especially helpful for those with special needs, such as the disabled or even clean and accessible toilet hunters. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works:\nRush Hour Detection: The application cross-checks the time and location information to find out how busy certain restrooms are. At rush hour, it will suggest less busy ones around so the users don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait.\nWheelchair Accessibility: The application screens and displays restrooms that are wheelchair-friendly. That is, facilities such as ramps, bigger doors, and handrails, so that the toilets are accessible and safe as well.\nRatings and Reviews: One can see the ratings of how clean, well-maintained, and functional every toilet is. One can even post their reviews and comments, allowing others to make the right choice.\nLive Location Display: It indicates the precise location of all toilets on a map with directions and walking distance estimated from the user\u0026rsquo;s position.\nAccessibility Information: It indicates whether the region is accessible with or without lifts for the disabled.\nParking Finder Application There is always a problem of people being unable to find a parking space within and around the tourist area. This App is a simple facility to help people locate vacant parking lots in an efficient way. It provides instant feedback on the number of available parking spaces, notifying the users whether the lot is full or not. This impedes parking cruising frustration, especially in busy city centres. Besides availability, the app also shows how much per parking space so that the users can see prices at a glance and compare in an instant. If anyone needs the nearest or the lowest priced one, then one can make the right choice with knowledge in a flash. The application also shows the exact location and distance of the parking lots from where the user is located, thus making the process an easy and convenient task.\nCarbon Emission Application The application is an original aspect that tracks and shows the level of carbon emissions in locations. The application can make estimates of the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted in an area depending on real-time environmental information.\nApplication for Blinds The application is intended for blind individuals who may require assistance with items in their lives, especially where they are new or challenging areas. If a user needs help, say to cross the road, move through a building, or get over some unexpected barrier, a person can use the app for help requests. The application then connects them with local volunteers, support staff, or assigned helpers who provide live comments. Through the incorporation of features like voice commands, global positioning, and live chat, the app provides location-based support at the moment to the blind person, thereby enhancing their safety and autonomy away from home.\nGovermental Transparency This is the main concern of the app in providing transparency and accountability for government spending. It aggregates data from official government reports and publicly disseminated announcements, following where tax dollars are flowing and being spent on what projects and initiatives. The app lays this out in plain, easy-to-understand terms, so users can easily see where the money is heading—infrastructure, education, healthcare, or otherwise. Through elucidating the monetary flows, the citizens are placed in a position where they have more knowledge and are interested in understanding how the government operates, thereby having a greater level of trust and responsive governance.\nMaximal Utilisation of Agricultural Land This is an influential aspect that leads to the productivity of a certain land. The higher productivity reduces the shortage of certain crops within a specific location. The applied information will be climatic information, soil information, and agricultural information. With this, the app would recommend a package of crops to communal farmers and occupational farmers. Farmers would choose one of the crops recommended in a bid to experience the highest possible yield, which would be most rewarding and combat communal hunger. Evacuation Assistant would lead the software user to evacuate a building room by determining the shortest path from the user to the exit, with robots/drones to scout around and check if it\u0026rsquo;s safe to proceed down that path.\n","permalink":"https://xknt21.github.io/contents/apr8/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"ideas\"\u003eIdeas:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"toilet-finder-application\"\u003eToilet Finder Application\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a smart app feature designed to help users easily and effectively find public toilets in their environment.

By capturing and uploading an image of a cat, users will be able to retrieve associated shelter records if the cat had previously been housed.\nThe system primarily addresses challenges related to post-shelter adoption by enabling potential adopters to determine the adoption status of stray cats outside the shelter environment.\nAdditionally, it offers broader support for stray cat population management and monitoring initiatives.\nKeywords: adoption; shelter; stray; re-identification; image recognition; SNR; Shelter-Neuter-Return\nProblem Statement - Background Urban animal shelters in many regions are overburdened and face legal or ethical restrictions against euthanizing animals. As a result, many cats that were once sheltered are returned to city streets.\nTo control the growing population of stray cats, many governments or organizations implement TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) or SNR (Shelter-Neuter-Return) programs. However, research has shown that simply implementing those programs is unable to decrease the number of stray cats, and that increasing the adoption rate is still the only approach [1].\nAdditionally, the process of adoption has multiple barriers. For example, shelters lose track of these cats after release, making it difficult to monitor their health or facilitate potential adoptions.\nIt is essential to lower the barriers to increase the adoption rate [2].\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a need for a data-driven system that allows society to stay connected to these animals, even after release.\nVision - Goals (EXAMPLE ONLY)\nThis system aims to empower cities to leverage agile principles in utilizing human capital to foster a thriving, dynamic workforce ecosystem.\nIn this ecosystem, individuals are empowered to acquire new skills and smoothly transition between jobs to meet evolving and emerging career demands, ensuring a workforce that is both adaptable and responsive to the city’s needs.\nObjectives - Features to be Realized Promote adoption Currently, people who wish to adopt cats often need to actively search for adoption information through websites, visit shelters, or attend occasional adoption events.\nOur project addresses this by allowing citizens to simply take a picture of a street cat using their smartphones and instantly receive information about the cat’s adoption status.\nTrack post-release wellbeing Our application offers a solution by digitally tracking sightings of identified cats.\nShelters and citizens can help monitor the cats’ health and general well-being over time.\nVerify vaccination Through our system, users can instantly verify a cat’s vaccination status by scanning them.\nKnowing whether a cat is vaccinated fosters safer interactions and encourages a more positive perception of stray cats.\nEnhance social connection By enabling citizens to recognize and learn the stories of individual cats, the application personalizes interactions.\nWhen people know a cat’s name, history, or past adoption attempts, it can trigger empathy and emotional bonding.\nScope (EXAMPLE ONLY)\nA single metropolitan area will be covered for the prototype.\nA limited subset of occupational segments will be covered based on available data for the prototype.\nLimitations and Risks Requires prior shelter records; only cats previously sheltered can be recognized. Risks of cat abuse if cat locations are publicly shared; better to restrict location info to shelters. Potential risks to user privacy due to location data sharing. Sustainability Initially, the application will be developed using a limited database.\nAs the user base grows, the system will identify and assign profiles to new cats, gradually expanding its database dynamically through real-world use.\nData Acquisition Using Existing Online Datasets: Search for publicly available cat image datasets. Directly Contacting Animal Shelters: Request access to photo archives. Web Scraping from Shelter Websites: Scrape images carefully, respecting legal standards. All images will be preprocessed for quality and privacy compliance.\nData Processing - Preprocessing Collected images will undergo:\nCleaning: Remove blurry, duplicate, or corrupted images. Standardization: Resize images and normalize pixel values. Annotation: Add metadata (e.g., unique IDs, shelter info, location). Augmentation: Apply flipping, rotation, brightness adjustments, and cropping. Images will be used to train CNNs, creating vector embeddings for rapid matching.\nData Science Techniques Image Preprocessing: OpenCV for resizing, normalization, etc. Feature Extraction: CNN models like ResNet or MobileNet. Siamese Network for Re-Identification: Using contrastive/triplet loss. Unsupervised Clustering: DBSCAN or k-means if labeled data is insufficient. Web Scraping: As a last resort. Data Visualization Profile Cards: Display cat details, health status, sighting timeline, etc. Map-Based Geolocation Visualization: Interactive map for last known cat locations. Performance Metric Dashboards: Visualize metrics like precision, recall, and confidence scores. Existing Prototypes Boulaouane et al.

By capturing and uploading an image of a cat, users will be able to retrieve associated shelter records if the cat had previously been housed.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe system primarily addresses challenges related to post-shelter adoption by enabling potential adopters to determine the adoption status of stray cats outside the shelter environment.\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditionally, it offers broader support for stray cat population management and monitoring initiatives.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Project Proposal"}]
