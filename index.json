[{"content":"Summary of Activities On May 13, our team focused on two major tasks:\nFinalizing the interview questions for animal shelters and organizations. Mapping responsibilities and categorizing non-functional requirements (NFRs) for each team member, aligned with key stakeholders. Interview Question Design – Animal Shelter Staff We brainstormed and refined a comprehensive list of questions to ask shelter staff in our upcoming interviews. These questions aim to deepen our understanding of real-world workflows, adoption procedures, and the shelter’s technical readiness to collaborate with our system.\nKey Question Categories: Shelter Operations \u0026amp; Policy Do you assign IDs to every cat? Do you track released cats, and how? What criteria determine whether a cat is adoptable or released? How do you intake stray cats and prepare them for adoption? Adoption Process What are the main steps from visitor to legal adoption? What is the most common reason for returned adoptions? How long does a typical adoption take? Data Collaboration \u0026amp; Technical Feasibility Are you open to uploading images to a system like ours? How tech-friendly are your staff? Could mobile uploads help? Do you already collect multi-angle photos? If not, is it feasible? How much time would it typically take to register one cat? What metadata (age, vaccination, neutering, etc.) is stored? Communication Preferences Would you prefer direct contact with users or filtered communication via the app? How should the app handle messaging between your staff and adopters? NFR \u0026amp; Stakeholder Responsibility Assignment We held a group planning session to assign stakeholders (RE) and non-functional requirement (NFR) categories to team members. These assignments were based on relevance to our system and individual roles. This also involved grouping NFRs into three main categories:\nStakeholders (RE – Requirements Elicitation) A: General Citizens / Volunteers – Jocelyn B: System Administrator – Anoma C: Animal Shelter Staff – Jonathan D: External Ethics \u0026amp; Law – Kanato E: Performance \u0026amp; Adoption Process – Parth F: Local Governments – Yukiya G: System Developers/Engineers – Ryusei Non-Functional Requirement Categories: Product-Related Usability (C) Efficiency (B) Dependability (B) Security (G) Performance (E) Space optimization (A) Organizational Environmental fit (F) Operational ease (A) Development feasibility (F) External Regulatory requirements Ethical and legal considerations (D) Security/safety compliance (D) This mapping will support a more structured approach during system modeling, requirement verification, and documentation.\nWe have talked about the interview questions for stakeholders.\n","permalink":"https://xknt21.github.io/contents/may13/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"summary-of-activities\"\u003eSummary of Activities\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn May 13, our team focused on two major tasks:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinalizing the interview questions for animal shelters and organizations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMapping responsibilities and categorizing non-functional requirements (NFRs) for each team member, aligned with key stakeholders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"interview-question-design--animal-shelter-staff\"\u003eInterview Question Design – Animal Shelter Staff\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe brainstormed and refined a comprehensive list of questions to ask shelter staff in our upcoming interviews.

This work session was dedicated to translating our conceptual design into more concrete technical concerns, especially related to cat image handling, recognition, and re-identification processes.\nTechnical Planning and Discussion We discussed the expected photo upload process from general users, particularly from smartphones. While the feature itself was already listed as a requirement, we focused on exploring the technical details and potential user behaviors. We identified the need to accept .jpg images from mobile users and started researching what image formats would be optimal for internal processing and model input. We agreed to seek expert input on whether conversion to other formats (e.g., .webp, .tiff) is recommended for performance or quality reasons. We talked about challenges users might introduce, such as blurry images or inconsistent angles, and decided to ask about data pre-processing techniques to handle these cases effectively.\nQuestions for Expert Consultation We prepared a list of specific technical questions to ask our professor or external advisors. These are aimed at improving the robustness and scalability of our AI system.\nRecognition Dataset Balance What ratio of cat images to non-cat images should we aim for when testing the object detection model? Re-identification Dataset Requirements What is the minimum number of images per individual cat that we should request from shelters? Are there specific angles (front, side, top) or lighting conditions that we should prioritize? Image Format \u0026amp; Handling Users will upload .jpg files. What is the best internal format to convert them to for training and inference? What tools or libraries are recommended for handling this conversion efficiently? Data Preprocessing What preprocessing methods are helpful to deal with partially blurry images? What techniques have you personally found essential in preparing data for training image models? Model Training Stability During training, if the model’s parameters don’t converge, what strategies can be applied? If you haven’t encountered this issue, is it mainly because the dataset was sufficiently large? Multi-Model Integration Concerns We plan to integrate multiple models (e.g., detection and re-identification). What are the typical problems (e.g., latency, conflicts) and how can we prepare for them? Key Insights and Planning Outcomes We realized that designing a user-friendly upload flow is just one side of the challenge — we also need to make sure the image data quality is good enough for reliable recognition. The importance of dataset quality and structure was emphasized, especially in terms of representing each individual cat adequately for re-identification. Our upcoming discussions with professors will focus on real-world experiences and best practices, rather than just theoretical knowledge.\nFocus of the Day: Designing User Flow and Shelter Interaction Logic On May 8, our team focused on designing detailed user workflows for both general users (citizens/volunteers) and shelter/organization staff. This session aimed to visualize how the system will manage image uploads, cat identification, profile handling, and communication between shelters and the app.\nUser Flow (Citizens/Volunteers) User Entry Options: Can start without signing up. Optional sign-up flow includes: full name, email, phone number, and password. Main Flow: User uploads a photo of a stray cat using the app. The system performs cat recognition: If a match is found, the user sees the cat’s profile page, which contains: Option to report injured or want to adopt. If no match is found: User is given the option to report a problem. A form allows the user to share location and photo. If signed in, personal info is auto-filled; if not, the user must input: Full name Phone number Email The report is sent to the shelter, and a confirmation email is issued to the user’s email address. Shelter / Organization Flow Designed administrative functions for shelters: Add New Cat Update Cat Profile When updating or adding a profile: Upload multiple images (exact number TBD) Enter cat details: Approximate age Vaccination status (including date if available) Whether the cat is neutered Also discussed the need to specify which shelter/organization owns the profile. Edit profile/pics functionality was included for future flexibility. Notes and Open Questions How many pictures per cat are necessary for reliable re-identification? Should vaccination input require both status and date? What should the fallback process be when recognition fails repeatedly? Outcomes Defined end-to-end user flows from photo upload to shelter contact. Visualized system branching logic based on recognition results. Clarified data requirements for cat profiles from shelters. Designed interaction model between general users and shelters through forms and email notifications.

Following the Shelter-Neuter-Return (SNR) program, many cats are released back into the urban environment without systematic tracking, making it difficult to monitor their wellbeing or promote their adoption.\nThere is a growing societal need for a solution that maintains a connection with these cats after their return, fostering animal welfare and enabling post-release care and adoption opportunities.\nRelated Applications Current applications primarily focus on pet identification and lost pet recovery (e.g., PetFinder, PawBoost). However, few address the unique needs of tracking and re-identifying community cats post-SNR programs at a societal scale.\nAdditionally, existing apps generally require owners\u0026rsquo; cooperation, while stray cats post-SNR lack dedicated guardians, highlighting a gap in service.\nLiterature Review and Government Reports Crawford Cat Dataset (Kaggle): A dataset containing labeled images of cats, useful for training initial models. \u0026ldquo;Siamese Networks for Cat Re-identification\u0026rdquo; (PapersWithCode): Demonstrates the efficacy of Siamese Networks in distinguishing between highly similar individual animals. Government Reports: Recent e-petitions in Taiwan indicate increasing public demand for humane stray animal management without euthanasia, emphasizing the importance of SNR initiatives. Other References: arXiv 2501.02112v1 - Latest methods for animal re-identification. HAL Archive Paper - Research on sustainable animal tracking. Springer Book Chapter - Machine learning for animal welfare solutions. Vision and Goals Promote Adoption: Maintain adoption opportunities post-release. Enhance Social Connection: Build a cat-friendly urban culture through awareness and interaction. Track Wellbeing: Monitor health and safety of community cats after release. Verify Vaccination: Enable instant verification of vaccination status through recognition. Objectives - Features to be Realized Develop a mobile application with real-time cat recognition via camera input. Display cat profiles including health, vaccination, and adoption information. Geolocation tagging to track areas where cats are frequently sighted. User feedback system to report injuries, illnesses, or sightings. Dashboards to visualize model performance (precision, recall). Scope (How Big the Problem Is) Tens of thousands of cats participate in SNR programs annually in Taiwan alone. Urban environments are dynamic and cats are mobile, making continuous manual tracking impossible without technological aid. This project targets urban centers with a dense SNR population, aiming to scale nationally or internationally.\nLimitations and Risks Accuracy Challenges: Recognizing individual cats with subtle visual differences may cause errors. Data Quality: User-submitted images may be blurry, low-quality, or mislabeled.\nPrivacy Concerns: Collecting geolocation data needs careful ethical consideration.\nAdoption Reluctance: Users may scan cats but few may move forward with adoptions.\nSustainability (Future Extensions) Integrate with shelter databases for automatic record updates. Expand to other species (e.g., dogs in TNR programs). Implement reward systems to encourage citizen participation. Utilize blockchain for decentralized, transparent health record-keeping. Data Acquisition Sources: Public datasets, shelter photo archives, user-submitted images. Methods: Collaboration with shelters for multi-angle pre-release photos. Data augmentation techniques to artificially expand datasets. Web scraping from shelter websites and social media. Preprocessing using OpenCV (cropping, noise reduction, normalization). Data Processing Apply image preprocessing (cropping, resizing, normalizing). Organize datasets by unique individual cat ID when available. Augment data for robustness against lighting and angle variations. Data Science Techniques Recognition Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. YOLOv2 and MobileNet for efficient, mobile-friendly detection. Siamese Networks for fine-grained individual cat re-identification. Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Model Inference Speed. Existing Prototypes Siamese Networks for pet re-identification exist but are not widely adopted in stray tracking scenarios. YOLO and MobileNet have lightweight mobile-ready models but need fine-tuning for the cat-specific domain.

Another idea is to create an approval system using a machine learning model or NLP model to filter out suggestions that are most likely not approved by the government or implement a system where a certain suggestion must reach a certain threshold to either be implemented or suggested in the first place.\nLow-Light Area Detecting Software: Problem Statement: Inadequate street lighting poses serious risks to public safety, including increased crime rates, higher chances of accidents, and reduced visibility for pedestrians and vehicles. Many urban and suburban areas lack comprehensive monitoring systems to identify regions with poor night-time illumination. Manual surveys are time-consuming, costly, and often outdated by the time they are compiled. There is a pressing need for an automated, scalable solution that can analyze geotagged nighttime imagery to detect and map low-light areas.\nObjective Statement: This software aims to utilize machine learning and image processing techniques to identify underlit regions using publicly available or crowdsourced street-level images and generate a dynamic heatmap to aid city planners and safety authorities in prioritizing lighting improvements.\nData Acquisition: Data will be obtained from open-source street view images available through sources like Google StreetView API. Further, we will be able to train a machine learning model to detect the presence of street lamps using images present on the Open Source Image Dataset V7 by Google Developers. The images from that dataset will be used for all the training, validation, and testing processes. As for the geotagged images, we will primarily use StreetView API, and we will also collect a few images ourselves.\nData Processing: Image processing will be used in this project idea for detecting streetlights. First the image will be segmented, and then the model will detect the presence of the streetlight. The YOLOv8 pretrained machine learning model will be used for this purpose.\nData Sources: Google StreetView API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/overview Open-Source Image Dataset V7: https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html\nSimilar Idea: https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/ja/map/map_285407#16/34.9972/138.4414\nTask: (Until April 24, 2025) Project proposal, it has to have the problem definition , related applications and literature or governmental report.

It\u0026rsquo;s especially helpful for those with special needs, such as the disabled or even clean and accessible toilet hunters. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works:\nRush Hour Detection: The application cross-checks the time and location information to find out how busy certain restrooms are. At rush hour, it will suggest less busy ones around so the users don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait.\nWheelchair Accessibility: The application screens and displays restrooms that are wheelchair-friendly. That is, facilities such as ramps, bigger doors, and handrails, so that the toilets are accessible and safe as well.\nRatings and Reviews: One can see the ratings of how clean, well-maintained, and functional every toilet is. One can even post their reviews and comments, allowing others to make the right choice.\nLive Location Display: It indicates the precise location of all toilets on a map with directions and walking distance estimated from the user\u0026rsquo;s position.\nAccessibility Information: It indicates whether the region is accessible with or without lifts for the disabled.\nParking Finder Application There is always a problem of people being unable to find a parking space within and around the tourist area. This App is a simple facility to help people locate vacant parking lots in an efficient way. It provides instant feedback on the number of available parking spaces, notifying the users whether the lot is full or not. This impedes parking cruising frustration, especially in busy city centres. Besides availability, the app also shows how much per parking space so that the users can see prices at a glance and compare in an instant. If anyone needs the nearest or the lowest priced one, then one can make the right choice with knowledge in a flash. The application also shows the exact location and distance of the parking lots from where the user is located, thus making the process an easy and convenient task.\nCarbon Emission Application The application is an original aspect that tracks and shows the level of carbon emissions in locations. The application can make estimates of the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted in an area depending on real-time environmental information.\nApplication for Blinds The application is intended for blind individuals who may require assistance with items in their lives, especially where they are new or challenging areas. If a user needs help, say to cross the road, move through a building, or get over some unexpected barrier, a person can use the app for help requests. The application then connects them with local volunteers, support staff, or assigned helpers who provide live comments. Through the incorporation of features like voice commands, global positioning, and live chat, the app provides location-based support at the moment to the blind person, thereby enhancing their safety and autonomy away from home.\nGovermental Transparency This is the main concern of the app in providing transparency and accountability for government spending. It aggregates data from official government reports and publicly disseminated announcements, following where tax dollars are flowing and being spent on what projects and initiatives. The app lays this out in plain, easy-to-understand terms, so users can easily see where the money is heading—infrastructure, education, healthcare, or otherwise. Through elucidating the monetary flows, the citizens are placed in a position where they have more knowledge and are interested in understanding how the government operates, thereby having a greater level of trust and responsive governance.\nMaximal Utilisation of Agricultural Land This is an influential aspect that leads to the productivity of a certain land. The higher productivity reduces the shortage of certain crops within a specific location. The applied information will be climatic information, soil information, and agricultural information. With this, the app would recommend a package of crops to communal farmers and occupational farmers. Farmers would choose one of the crops recommended in a bid to experience the highest possible yield, which would be most rewarding and combat communal hunger. Evacuation Assistant would lead the software user to evacuate a building room by determining the shortest path from the user to the exit, with robots/drones to scout around and check if it\u0026rsquo;s safe to proceed down that path.\n","permalink":"https://xknt21.github.io/contents/apr8/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"ideas\"\u003eIdeas:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"toilet-finder-application\"\u003eToilet Finder Application\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a smart app feature designed to help users easily and effectively find public toilets in their environment.

By capturing and uploading an image of a cat, users will be able to retrieve associated shelter records if the cat had previously been housed.\nThe system primarily addresses challenges related to post-shelter adoption by enabling potential adopters to determine the adoption status of stray cats outside the shelter environment.\nAdditionally, it offers broader support for stray cat population management and monitoring initiatives.\nKeywords: adoption; shelter; stray; re-identification; image recognition; SNR; Shelter-Neuter-Return\n1. Problem Statement - Background Urban animal shelters in many regions are overburdened and face legal or ethical restrictions against euthanizing animals. As a result, many cats that were once sheltered are returned to city streets.\nTo control the growing population of stray cats, many governments or organizations implement TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) or SNR (Shelter-Neuter-Return) programs. However, research has shown that simply implementing those programs is unable to decrease the number of stray cats, and that increasing the adoption rate is still the only approach [1].\nAdditionally, the process of adoption has multiple barriers. For example, shelters lose track of these cats after release, making it difficult to monitor their health or facilitate potential adoptions.\nIt is essential to lower the barriers to increase the adoption rate [2].\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a need for a data-driven system that allows society to stay connected to these animals, even after release.\n2. Vision - Goals The primary vision of this project is to modernize the management of stray cat populations by introducing a scalable, AI-based re-identification system that can recognize individual stray cats after their release. This system aims to bridge the current welfare gap caused by the inability to track post-release cats, thereby improving both animal welfare and resource efficiency in shelters [10] [11].\nWe envision a society where stray cats are no longer invisible after neutering and release. Instead, each cat will have a persistent digital profile that shelters and citizens can access, update, and use for health monitoring, rescue operations, and potential adoption promotion. Such visibility can drastically increase rescue rates, reduce redundant neutering operations, and boost responsible citizen participation [11].\nA second major goal is to support environmental conservation. By keeping track of stray cat populations and their health, local governments can control ecological impacts caused by stray cats, especially predation on native wildlife [11]. An organized system would also help local governments better allocate public resources, avoiding unnecessary financial waste through smarter capture and treatment strategies [10].\nUltimately, this project aims to serve as a global model. If successful, the solution developed here could be replicated internationally, especially in countries like Japan, Taiwan, Australia, the UK, and the US, where stray cat issues are a major urban problem [7] [8] [9].\nThus, the vision is to create a humane, efficient, and sustainable system that improves the lives of stray cats, supports shelter operations, protects urban biodiversity, and fosters a sense of shared responsibility between citizens and local governments.\n3. Objectives - Features to be Realized 3.1 Promote adoption Currently, people who wish to adopt cats often need to actively search for adoption information through websites, visit shelters, or attend occasional adoption events.\nOur project addresses this by allowing citizens to simply take a picture of a street cat using their smartphones and instantly receive information about the cat’s adoption status.\n3.2 Track post-release wellbeing After release, monitoring the condition of cats becomes almost impossible under traditional SNR programs. Our application offers a solution by digitally tracking sightings of identified cats. Shelters and citizens can help monitor the cats’ health and general well being over time. Early detection of health issues, injuries or behavioral changes can lead to timely intervention, thus improving overall urban animal welfare.\n3.3 Verify vaccination Public safety and animal health are critical concerns. Through our system, users can instantly verify a cat’s vaccination status by scanning them. Knowing whether a cat is vaccinated in real time fosters safer interactions and encourages a more positive perception of stray cats in urban environments. It also assists authorities and shelters in managing vaccination schedules effectively .\n3.4 Enhance social connection Often, street cats are viewed as anonymous creatures with little to no personal connection to the human community. By enabling citizens to recognize and learn the stories of individual cats, the application helps to personalize interactions. When people know a cat’s name, history, or past adoption attempts, it can trigger empathy and emotional bonding, promoting a sense of shared responsibility toward these animals and strengthening community ties.\n4. Scope 4.1 Issues at Hand Caused by the Major Problem Large Number of Stray Cats Taiwan faces a major stray animal issue, with over 160,000 stray cats and dogs reported [10]. This number is increasing yearly due to abandonment and unregulated breeding. Globally, the problem is even bigger; for example, the USA alone has an estimated 30–80 million stray cats living on the streets [12]. These high numbers show that stray animals are a long-term and large-scale problem that cities are struggling to manage.\nShelters Are Overloaded In Taiwan, shelters can accommodate only about 3% of stray animals [10]. This means 97% of strays remain outside or are re-released through SNR programs. Overcrowded shelters cannot properly care for the animals, and new arrivals are often turned away. Therefore, SNR becomes a necessary but imperfect solution where the animal is released but loses all official connection to the shelter system.\nPost-Release Cats Are Forgotten After being neutered and returned, these cats are no longer tracked by shelters [10]. There’s no monitoring for illnesses, injuries, or changes in behavior. This creates a huge welfare gap — if a cat gets sick or hurt after release, no one notices unless a random citizen reports it. The lack of a reconnection method also limits opportunities for future adoption or rescue.\nCurrent Tracking Methods Are Weak The only current method of identifying SNR cats is through ear-tipping, a practice where a small part of the cat’s ear is clipped to indicate it was neutered [12]. However, ear-tipping does not distinguish individual cats. It tells you the cat has been neutered, but not which cat it is. There is no system to recognize a particular cat or follow its health or status over time.\nFinancial Costs Are Huge Managing strays without a tracking system is extremely cost-inefficient. Taiwan’s local governments spend millions each year on capturing, neutering, and handling stray animals [3]. Without good tracking, shelters and government workers waste resources by mistakenly re-catching neutered cats or failing to prioritize sick ones. Long term, this drives up costs for cities and leads to inefficient use of public funds.\n4.2 Benefits to Solving This Problem Improves Animal Welfare Having a system to identify and monitor released cats would help shelters and citizens quickly detect illnesses or injuries. Sick or hurt cats could be rescued faster instead of being left unnoticed on the streets. This would significantly improve the quality of life for thousands of animals [10].\nSaves Shelter Resources Smart re-identification could reduce unnecessary effort for shelters. Instead of capturing cats blindly, they could target cats that need urgent care based on updated information. This means shelters can spend more time and money on treatment, adoptions, and education programs rather than redoing work [10].\nBoosts Cat Adoption Rates With a system that can recognize individual cats on the streets, citizens interested in adoption could look up information easily. If a particular stray is healthy and friendly, it would be much easier to promote and find adopters. This could increase adoption rates and reduce the overall stray population [12].\nProtects Other Wildlife Stray cats are known to hunt and harm native wildlife, especially birds and small mammals [12]. By keeping better track of stray cats, cities could reduce the ecological impact caused by unmonitored cat colonies, helping to protect biodiversity.\nUses Modern Technology for Purposes Beneficial to the Environment AI-driven re-identification technologies (like Siamese Networks) are already showing success in identifying individual animals [4]. Applying this technology to stray cats offers a practical, scalable solution to a real social problem. It also opens the door for similar smart monitoring systems for other urban animals worldwide.\nIn summary, this problem is worth solving because, the stray cats at large cause and overload in available shelters, further causing sheltered cats to be forgotten after their release, which is fuelled by the lack of modernization in the methods used to track them. Solving this major problem would improve the welfare of the cats and other animals around them, further saving resources and other local wildlife, along with boosting adoption rates for stray cats. This project encourages the use of modern information systems for this specific purpose as related projects have demonstrated accordingly.\n5. Limitations and Risks This application relies on the shelters or organizations to build up the data of information of cats, which indicates that the cats must be sheltered once to leave the record. Also, it leads to greater costs needed to promote the SNR program. There is a substantial risk of sharing the location where the cats usually stay as there are perpetrators of cat abuse. It may be more secure if the locations are only shared with the shelter or organizations to be able to perform any rescue if needed. As the application requires users to upload and share the location of the photos, there may be potential risk in users’ privacy too.\n6. Sustainability Initially, the application will be developed from a limited database of stray cat images collected by the team. As the user base grows, the system can implement a feature to identify and re-identify cats not present in the original database. Through repeated sightings and visual pattern matching, the app can gradually assign unique profiles to these cats, allowing the database to expand dynamically. This approach enables the system to adapt to new environments and continuously improve its accuracy through real-world usage and community feedback.\n7. Data Strategy 7.1 Data Acquisition To support the identification and re-identification of stray cats, our team will collect image data from multiple sources, focusing on capturing cats from various angles (ideally 360-degree coverage) to ensure robust pattern recognition. The primary data acquisition methods are as follows:\n7.1.1 Using Existing Online Datasets First, we will search for publicly available datasets that contain images of cats. Some research communities and open-access repositories provide datasets featuring cats in various environments, which can serve as a foundation for building our database.\n7.1.2 Directly Contacting Animal Shelters To supplement existing datasets, we will directly contact animal shelters and rescue organizations to request access to their photo archives. These institutions often take multiple photos of each animal from different angles for adoption purposes, which would be highly valuable for our re-identification training.\n7.1.3 Web Scraping from Shelter Websites If we are unable to find a sufficient amount of data through existing datasets or direct contact with shelters, we will use web scraping techniques to collect images from the websites of animal shelters. This method will be used carefully, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards regarding data collection.\nAll images will be preprocessed for quality and privacy compliance.\n7.2 Data Processing - Preprocessing Collected images will undergo:\n7.2.1 Cleaning: Remove blurry, duplicate, or corrupted images. 7.2.2 Standardization: Resize images and normalize pixel values. 7.2.3 Annotation: Add metadata (e.g., unique IDs, shelter info, location). 7.2.4 Augmentation: Apply flipping, rotation, brightness adjustments, and cropping. Images will be used to train CNNs, creating vector embeddings for rapid matching.\n7.3 Data Science Techniques The following data science techniques will be used to power the smart stray cat re-identification system:\n7.3.1 Image Preprocessing with OpenCV (Pre-Processing)\nAll collected images will undergo preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, noise reduction, and edge detection using OpenCV. These steps will improve the quality and consistency of data used for model training.\n7.3.2 Feature Extraction Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (Extracting features of cats)\nWe will use pre-trained deep learning models such as ResNet or MobileNet for extracting distinguishing visual features like fur pattern, eye shape, and ear position. These models are well suited for image-based classification tasks.\n7.3.3 Siamese Network for Re-Identification (Recognition)\nTo determine whether two images represent the same cat, we will use a Siamese Neural Network trained with contrastive loss or triplet loss. These models are effective in learning a similarity function and have been used in human and animal re-identification tasks.\n7.3.4 Unsupervised Clustering (Classifying)\nWhen labeled data is insufficient, clustering techniques such as DBSCAN or k-means may be used to group similar cats together based on extracted features. Web Scraping as a Last Resort: If the manually collected or community-contributed images prove insufficient, we will utilize web scraping to collect cat images from public forums, social media, and open-source databases. These technologies together create a robust pipeline capable of handling the complexity and variability of real-world stray cat identification.\n7.4 Data Visualization The following data visualization techniques will be used to enhance the smart stray cat re-identification system which will feature a smart mobile application with a built-in cat recognition camera feature:\n7.4.1 Profile Cards\nAfter users submit images of the desired cat, a profile card will present essential information such as the cat’s name, breed (if identifiable), adoption status, last vaccination date (if available), and contact details for the associated shelter. Additionally, users can add additional information regarding the cat that they are reporting during the submission process, be it injuries or concerns which can be seen by other users and community members. Lastly, each cat within the database will have a unique identifier that users can refer to when searching for a specific cat’s profile.\n7.4.2 Performance Metric Dashboards\nTo maintain the reliability of the system, administrators will have access to dashboards visualizing key performance metrics such as precision, recall, and confidence scores. Bar charts, ROC curves, and simple statistical summaries will be used to monitor system accuracy and minimize false identifications. This internal visualization ensures that the app remains trustworthy for users and allows administrators to spot areas that are of concern such as a certain breed of cat not being optimized or other varying concerns.\n8.
